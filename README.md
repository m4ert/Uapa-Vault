This repository serves as a personal archive of assignments, exercises, and projects from my studies at the **Universidad Abierta Para Adultos (UAPA)**.

## 💡 About the Code

While the primary goal of these projects was meeting academic deadlines, I commit to maintaining clear project documentation (within each respective project folder).

### What you can expect:
* **Academic Focus:** Code that directly addresses the specific requirements of the university assignments.
* **Functional Priority:** Projects were focused on achieving the required output and functionality first.
* **Clear Documentation:** Each project folder aims to include a `README.md` or similar file explaining the project's purpose, setup, and key features.
* **Progress Log:** This repo charts my skill development and approach to problem-solving throughout my degree.
